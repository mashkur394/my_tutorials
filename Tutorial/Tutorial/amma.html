    <!-- <H2>AMMA LOSES A GREAT MAN</h2>
<p>one evening, after we had our  meal, ray and I with other kids in the neighbour
hood hurried to pa uta"s house for our usual moonlight stories.</p>     
<p>but as we got there, we saw a lot of people in the compound_elders and women who 
had never been part of our moonlight gathering were there that evening. the children 
too who had also come for the moonlight stories were not seated and something in my
mind told me that all was not well.</p>      

<p>what's going on here?" i asked staring at everyone"s teary face. but it seemed that 
had the courage to talk to me "jude" my elder brother screamed my name in shork as 
he ran out of pa uta"s house. he had run ahead of me to find out what was happening 
. he heald my hands" with tears running down his cheeks. ray what"s wrong? i asked
in fear, holding him tight. pa uta is dead' my brother broke the new to  me they said
he had been very sick all this while. i was shocked beyond his word. and like water
tears ran down my eyes. i looked at the other children around and i saw that their 
tears were becoming more as they watched me cry. quickly, i wiped the tears that had 
gathered  my eyes with  the back of my hand and tried to put myself together. of all 
kid that often gathered to listen to pa uta' s stories, i could rightly say i was the 
closest to him. he was fund  will complain that i asked 
too many questions most of which he said were beyond my age. pa uta died at the age 102
yrs he was the second oldest person in amma village at the time. to all children of amma 
, he was legend his stories were unique;  they were different from all otherof me and always referred to me as a child after his heart
. i always answered most of his questions but some times he stories we 
had heard and were full of good morals dad did you mean pa uta taught you how a story 
book? my child, pa uta taught me a lot of thing but storytelling is indeed a gift from god </p>
